        There are 7 traditional planets used in astrology. They are defined by their ability to be seen from Earth without a telescope or pollution. They are best understood when ordered by their speed:
           </p>
    <ol class="three">
            <li>Moon</li>
           <li>Mercury</li>
            <li>Venus</li>
            <li>Sun</li>
            <li>Mars</li>
            <li>Jupiter</li>
            <li>Saturn</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="three">These planets' orbit around the zodiac is central to their symbolic meanings. For example, Saturn's slow speed makes it a symbol of antiquity, old age, and death. Meanwhile, Mercury's fast pace and tendency to retrograde makes it a symbol of everything that goes back and forth at rapid paces: communication, commerce, transportation, and trade. 
        </p>
        <p class="three">The symbolic meaning of the planets extend into a larger symbolic structure known as planetary rulership schemes. It's pretty simple: planets rule over signs. Each planet has two signs it rules over, excluding the luminaries i.e. the Sun and the Moon:</p>

             <p class="three"> Because certain planets rule over certain signs, the symbolic meaning of the signs are tied to their ruling planet as well as their modality and element (alternatively, quadruplicity and triplicity). The table on the left puts it all together.  
    </p>
            <p class="three"> Take for example the signs Libra and Taurus. Both signs are ruled by Venus, but they are belong to different elements and modalities. Venus, the planet of love, represents everything that is beautiful and beautifying. Both Libra and Taurus have a deep appreciation and need for beauty, but both showcase different sides of this Venusian concept. Taurus, an Earth sign, showcases the materiality of beauty: flowers in spring, moistuirized skin, luxurious fabrics, etc. As a Fixed sign, Taurus maintains the beauty on Earth and finds the beauty in its material resources. Libra, an air sign, showcases the ideals of beauty and how it plays out in social contexts: balance, justice, and harmony. As a Cardinal sign, Libra creates and initiates balanced, just, and harmonious relationships. 
    </p>
            
<p class="three">All that being said, we have to remember the basic meanings of the planets is all theoretical. In theory, Mars rules over Aries and Scorpio and has nothing to do with a Jupiter-ruled sign like Pisces or Sagittarius. However, in reality on Earth, the planets are always moving in the sky. Every planet has the opportunity to go through all twelve signs (and repeat!) due to the cyclical path it follows. The sign a planet is in modifies the planet's basic expression. You can have a Jupiterean Mars, a Saturnian Mercury, a Mercurial Venus, a Solar Saturn, etc. The last and final <a href="part4.html">part</a> provides instructions for the last step to astrology: translating theory into real life!
