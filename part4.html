    <h1 class="four">IV. The Chart</h1>
    <div id="b4">
    <p class="four">In order to translate astrological theory into real life, we have to use a very important diagram: an astrological chart. Charts are an easy way to depict and read the positions of the planets in the Earth's sky from a specific point in time and place. They take you from isolated signs and planets to contextualized planets in signs in houses. But how do we read a chart? </p>
    <div id="chart1">

        </div>
    <p class="four">The chart consists of planets in signs in houses in a circle. The planets are represented by the glyphs inside the circle. The signs are on the edge of each section of the circle. The sections of the circle are the houses.</p>
    
    <p class="four">There are technically two circles within your chart. The first circle is fixed in place. It is a circle of houses. Depending on which house system you use (there's a lot), the rules vary for dividing the houses but whole sign is the most simple. It divides the houses into twelve 30 degree sections, each one occupied by one of the twelve 30 degree zodiac signs. Houses represent areas of life. Their meaning is further modified by the sign they are in and the planet that rules that sign, information provided by the second circle.</p>
    <p class="four"> The second circle represents the ecliptic, the 7 traditional planets' zodiac-studded path in the Earth's sky. When laid flat and divided into twelve 30 degree sections, the ecliptic looks like this:</p>

         </div>
    <p class="four"> Another circle! This circle is rooted in two pairs of points/angles. In the East and West, we have respectively the Ascendant and Descendant. Together, they mark the horizon (sunrise and sunset). In the North and South we have respectively the Midheaven (MC) and the Imum Coeli (IC). They represent points where the ecliptic crosses the local meridian (midday and midnight).</p>
    <p class="four">
        The last thing to know about this special second circle: it moves! Although the order of the twelve zodiac signs is fixed in Earth's sky, the sign rising on the eastern horizon varies depending on the hour of the day and where you are located on Earth. As such, it is responsible for ordering your chart. If Aries was rising on the eastern horizon, the chart would be an Aries Rising meaning the first house=Aries, the second house=Taurus, the third house=Gemini, and so on. If Aquarius was rising, the first house=Aquarius, the second house=Pisces, the third house=Aries, the fourth house=Taurus, and so on.

        When we put this altogether, we get a picture of what the sky looked like in relation to a specific event or moment in time. Most commonly, charts are cast at the moment of someone's birth. This is what is known as birthcharts, a picture of what the sky looked like at the time and place of your birth. The particular position of the planets is supposed to provide you with information about your life.
