            <p class="one">Imagine it is night and you are outside. Because this is imaginary, let's say the sky is not polluted and you can see all the stars. Repeat this activity weekly for a few months. </p>
        <p class="one">After a few weeks, you may notice how some stars do not move while other stars do. The moving stars are what we call planets. Astrology characterizes these planets, as well as the Sun and Moon, by their movement along the same path in the Earth's sky, A.K.A. the ecliptic. Along the ecliptic are twelve constellations of fixed stars, A.K.A. the Zodiac. </p>

        <p class="one">When astrologers say "XYZ planet is in XYZ sign," they are referring to the APPARENT position of the planets in the Earth's sky along the ecliptic, not the actual position of the planets in the solar system. Central to astrology is our unique perspective from Earth.</p>
        <p class="one">
        Astrologers interpret the zodiacal motion of the planets as signs of events/phenomena on Earth. The planets are not necessarily the cause of said events. They are simply a sign of something that is going to happen/is happening. If you follow the planets long enough, you realize there is nothing to "believe" in when it comes to astrology. Of course there is theory behind the practice and faith is obviously appreciated but but all you really have to do is watch, take notes, study, and the patterns will reveal themselves to you.
